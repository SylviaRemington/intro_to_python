# Performing Mathematical Operations in Python
# Python has the normal math operators that you are used to from JavaScript:

# Addition (+)
# Subtraction (-)
# Multiplication (*)
# Division (/)
# Modulo (remainder) (%)
# Exponentiation (**)

new_num = 10 ** 2
print(new_num)

# Integer Division
result = 4 / 2
print(result)
# In the answer, it gave us a float

# You can force it to give an integer if you add two //
result = 4 // 2
print(result)
# It's flooring doing this division.


result = 5 // 2
print(result)
# It's flooring doing this division.
# This means that it will still give an integer even if the actual answer is 2.5
# It rounds it down.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Shortcut Assignment Operators
# Notice no linting errors which shows it is valid linting code

# this line of code:
num = num + 1
# can be written with this shortcut operator:
num += 1

# it also works for any of the other math operations:
num = num / 5
# can be rewritten like this:
num /= 5

# and this line:
num = num * 3
# can be written as this:
num *= 3
# and so on with the other operators

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Can't use num++
# A couple of our favorite operators in JavaScript, increment (++) and decrement (â€“), 
# do not exist in Python. Use += 1 and -= 1 instead.
